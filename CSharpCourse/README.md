# C# Course

This a basic C# course just so I get used to the syntax and how to write the simple OO structures that I learned in other languages like Python and JavaScript.

I am learning C# for a new internship opportunity I managed to get and don't want to start it without learning at the very least the basics of the syntax!

### Used technologies (well, that's kinda obvious)
