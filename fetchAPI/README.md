# FetchAPI Course

This course approaches the consumption of an API Rest with JS. I think that a really important point to make in here about the code is that most of it was **not** written by me, because since the actual goal here is to learn about consuming the API, there wasn't really a point in writting all that HTML, CSS and the API itself, the files I worked with are the JS ones.
In this project I learned how to work with Postman, which was actually a pretty smooth experience because I have already used a little bit of Insomnia in other moments and had already liked how it worked (of course it was really superficial since it's such a small program, so I obviously didn't have to deal with hundreds or thousands of requests, but I still think it's a valid experience).
I do have a lot of data in Brazilian portuguese in the files, which I usually avoid, but since the base project wasn't written by me, I kept them like they were so I wouldn't have issues with paths, functions and variables that already existed previously.
Since I consume so much of their content and the whole base of the project was written by them, I feel like I should give the due credit to Alura, the brazilian platform where I make a lot of my courses, including this one!
